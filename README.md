# Cartpole Project
MEng Engineering at the University of Cambridge  
IIA (3rd year) project on machine learning  
29 August 2020

_From the [project brief](http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/content/engineering-tripos-part-iia-project-sf3-machine-learning-2019-20)_

> In this project, students will consider the inverted pendulum system receiving a software simulator of a cart with a pendulum attached written in Python.
 
> The goal will be to learn a controller that balances the pendulum in a data-driven way. The students will initially learn how to operate the simulator and explore the different types of behaviour that the system can exhibit. Next, they will collect training data from the simulator and use this to train non-linear regression models, including linear regression with non-linear basis functions. The trained models will be assessed on test data from the simulator. Once accurate models are learned these will be used to learn controllers that can balance the pendulum in the upright position and keep it there. Data-efficient model-based reinforcement learning techniques will be used for this stage. Finally, the controllers and the models will will be stress tested in various ways to test their robustness.
